# Data Exploration Step

The first step before pre-processing the data is to explore its 
contents and try to find useful insights that will help us build the
data model.

Each of the Jupyter Notebook files contained in this folder execute 
an exploratory analysis of the data. When required small adjustments are 
applied to the dataset. 

The result files that will be used for further analysis are copied or 
exported to the folder `./../datasets/results`.

#Â Running the files in this project

The easiest way to run Jupyter Notebooks in your personal computer is 
by installing the [Anaconda Platform](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

Then you can start Jupyter Notebook and open the files of this folder.

# File Structure

All the files in this folder are Jupyter Notebook files:

- `climate-change.ipynb`: Explores the climate change dataset.
- `suicide-rates.ipynb`: Explores the suicide rates dataset.
- `world-happiness-report.ipynb`: Explores the world happiness report dataset.
- `world-indicators.ipynb`: Explores the world development indicators dataset.
